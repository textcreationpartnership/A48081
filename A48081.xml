            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

That we may no longer (if God permit) lay our selves open to such inconveniences, nor encourage the hopes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Enemies, We are resolved, through the blessing of God, and we do heartily and freely agree together, to walk together in love, and due observance of our duties in our places, and not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our selves (so far as God shall help us) to he divided or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted, but to stand fixed as an united body in the prosecution of every good thing that the Providence of God shall call us forth unto, under the Conduct and Regulation following:</p>

To the intent that no single Person whatsoever may have a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to debauch the Armies or Forces of this Commonwealth, or work them to any base or selvish interest, or render them serviceable to his lusts; We do hereby agree, consent, and declate, That Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> Major General <hi>John Lambert,</hi> Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary General <hi>John Disbrow,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> Lieutenant General <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and Collonel <hi>James Berry,</hi> or any four of them, be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Nominations, and have power to agree upon Officers for such vacancies as shall be in the Armies and Forces of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, from time to time; and such persons as shall be agreed upon, and certified under the Hands of any three of them, shall be by the Commander in Chief commissioned accordingly, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have received your Letter of the Nineteenth Instant, with the inclosed printed Paper, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nine Resolves, or Agreements, touching the Government of the Army. And to such of them we have returned you our distinct Answer; Hoping that if you shall find wee have reason and Conscience to plead for us (as we are verily of opinion we have) you will be so far from pressing Subscription of them upon us, that you will retract it your selves, or, out of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an tenderness, to afford us such satisfaction as may endeavour us to joyn with you in it; Of which satisfaction, we acknowledge our selves as yet altogether destitute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Preface We shall only say this, That we are as sensible of the distracted condition of this Commonwealth (to the grief of our souls we speak it) as any men living, and shall as heartily and freely endeavour to cement the same, and that with peculiar relation to those of the Army as well as of the Commonwealth; but whether the way you have propounded be warrantable by the Word of God, suitable to our Engagements, or competent to such an end, Our Answer to the several heads of your <hi>Agreement</hi> will sufficiently make manifest.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101169:4"/>
            <p> To the first, we say, and unanimously declare, That the Armies of these Nations (whereof we are a part) were raised by Authority of the present Parliament, for the defence of our Religion, the Laws and Liberties of our Nation, and Priviledges of Parliament; from that Authority we received our Commissions; to the defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are by sundry Vows and Engagements obliged (some of them of a very late date) your late Petition to them, and solemn accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Commissions from them, are sufficient acknowledgments that to them belongeth the right of making a Commander in Chief, and other subordinate Officers, and therefore for us to usurp it, were a manifest breach of their acknowledged Priviledge, and a direct way to subject the Nation under an Arbitrary and Tyrannical Government, which is the abhorring of our souls, and against which we have hitherto with so happy success born Arms.</p>
            <p>To the second and third, our Answer is the same.</p>
            <p>To the fourth, fifth and sixth, Our Answer hath a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the Answer to the first, <hi>viz.</hi> That we cannot prescribe to the Parliament in this case, but shall readily submit to the method proposed, the same being allowed by Parliament, to whom we shall readily joyn our desire with you in this particular, Save that the Commissions be signed by the <hi>Speaker,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Hasselrag,</hi> and Generall <hi>Monck</hi> be of the Number of Commissioners for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
            <p>To the seventh, We agree it to be our desire, That none but god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men, of Courage, Ability and good Conversation be admitted into Places of Trust in the Army.</p>
            <p>To the eighth, We agree it to be our desire, That no Officer be displaced but by a Court Martial, so far as it relates to the Discipline of Warr, but not as it may be extended to the Abridgment of the Power of Parliament.</p>
            <p>To the ninth, We agree it to be our desire, That the Discipline of the Army be kept inviolable, Justice administred, Godlinesse encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and all manner of Sin punished.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:101169:5"/>
            <p> And although the tie of Conscience and Duty obliges us to dissent from you in sundry the forementioned Particulars (as the State of Affairs now stands) Yet we solemnly professe, that such our Dissent doth not proceed from any disrespect we bear to the Persons menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in Your Agreement; We bear great honour and affection to most of them as Persons that have eminently asserted the Rights of their Country, countenanced Godlinesse, and been blest of God in so doing; our only aim is, so to regulate the authority of such as we entrust in the Army, as that it be commensurate to the Government by a Commonwealth, in which (if yours and our solmn professions to God and Man be worthy of Credit) we cannot but agree and Remain,</p>
